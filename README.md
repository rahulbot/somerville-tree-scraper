Somerville, MA Tree Data
========================

This repo contains government-created datasets about trees in Somerville, MA, USA. Data from the two audits I have found are posted here. Unfortunately the data collected isn't quite the same, so tree-to-tree comparison would take some work.

## 2017/2018 audit

The results were [posted on the Tree Keeper system](https://somervillema.treekeepersoftware.com) so I was able to select all of them with the rectangle tool and download a CSV directly.

## 2009 Audit

The results were posted on a website with public guest login so anyone can see them.  The information  wasn't available in a machine-readable format, so I created this software to scrape  the website and create a CSV file with all the information about each tree.  This code is archived on the `2009-audit` branch.
